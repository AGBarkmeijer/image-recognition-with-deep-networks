    "# Vectorial Word Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Representing words as dense vectors over a finite-dimensional space was one of the recent breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing. Vectorial representations allow space-efficient, informationally rich storage of words that adequately captures their semantic content and enables numerical computation on them. Word vectors are the standard input representation for machine learning architectures for language processing. Even though new methods for constructing such representations emerge frequently, the original set of published papers remain a de facto point of reference as well as a good starting point. For this assignment, you will be asked to implement a small-scale variant of one such paper, namely [Global Word Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the code and data pre-processing has already been done for you. Additionally, notes on the paper will appear throughout the notebook to guide you along the code. It is, however, important to read and understand the paper, its terminology and the theory behind it before attempting to go through with the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For conceptual questions, give short but descriptive answers. Each sub-part (1.0-1.9) makes for 1 point out of a total of 10. "

    "## Corpus Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper's proposed model, GloVe, aims to densely represent words in a way that captures the global corpus statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The construction it encodes is the word __co-occurrence matrix__. A co-occurrence matrix is a simplistic data structure that counts the amount of times each word has appeared within the context of each other word. The definition of a context varies; usually, context is implied to be a fixed-length span (that may or may not be allowed to escape sentence boundaries) around a word. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the sentence below and for a context length of 2, the word <span style=\"color:pink\">__Earth__</span> occurs in the context of <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">made</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">on</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">as</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">an</span> (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"He struck most of the friends he had <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">made on</span> <span style=\"color:pink\">__Earth__</span> <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">as an</span> eccentric\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the word <span style=\"color:pink\">__friends__</span> occurs in the context of <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">of</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">the</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">he</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">had</span> (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"He struck most <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">of the</span> <span style=\"color:pink\">__friends__</span> <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">he had</span> made on Earth as an eccentric\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative definition of a context would be, for instance, the variable-length windows spanned by a full sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contexts may be summed across sentences or entire corpora; the summed context of <span style=\"color:pink\">he</span> in the example sentence is: <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">struck</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">most</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">the</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">friends</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">had</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">made</span> (1).\n",
