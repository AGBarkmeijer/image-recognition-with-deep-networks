# Imagine Recognition in Human Vision in R (MLHVL 2020 @ uu.nl)

This git repository is part of a lab assignment given during the 2020 lecture of *"Machine Learning in Human Vision and
Language"* (MLHVL). It contains all source code written **by lab team 17** for the first part of the lectures assignments.
This first part consists of constructing multiple **models** to illustrate the benefits of using **Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks** (DCNNs) in **image recognition tasks**, such as classifying the widely-known **MNIST dataset**. These are

* A **Multi-Layer-Perceptron** (MLP) _with and without_ activation function on MNIST
* A DCNN trained on MNIST
* A DCNN on CIFAR-10

These will be contained in their own .R scripts.

Furthermore, a collection of functions, realizing the low-level operations performed during deep learning, will be
collected in their own script.
